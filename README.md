# Overview

The purpose of this program was for me to learn how to program in Dart language.  This particular program was meant to teach me how to use classes, methods, functions, comparisons, and error-checking in Dart.

This code is base software for a mobile app I'm hoping to develop.  The app is supposed to be a "travel log" of sorts, where it stores information about a vacation someone had taken.  It would have a start and end date, the location, the purpose of going (such as a honeymoon or family reunion), a list of friends and/or family that went on vacation with the user, and some photos.  I haven't been able to implement actually displaying the photos, nor do I know if I can do that in VS Code, so I decided to store filenames of photos instead.  After the program prompts the user for all that information, it displays all of it for the user.

# Development Environment

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Language: Dart with 'dart:io' library

Version Control System: Git

# Useful Website

* [Dart Tutorials](https://dart.dev/tutorials)

# Future Work

* Write the code to be able to display actual photos in a mobile app emulator (such as Android Studio).
* Learn how to use Dart styling and make my code more readable and look more professional.
* Learn how to implement more user-friendly methods of picking the start and end date (such as a drop-down menu or calendar display).
